Android app for low/no vision individuals

This is a project I started in 2010 to help people with no vision at all. The objective is to have an app that replaces basic telephone functions with very simple (mainly vertical) spoken windows.
User can control screen by using the volume controls - volume up/down changes the focus of the component on the screen - and activate the currently selected button with a two-fingers tap.
To catch a ringing call: two single-finger tap on the screen
To decline (or end) a call: three single-finger tap on the screen


**Before running the app:**

1. Make sure you have a text to speech engine properly installed and configured on your mobile phone ( Settings > Accessibility > text-to-speech output ).
2. Disable screen unlock pattern / password. If you really want something to unlock screen use swipe to unlock.
3. Make sure you grant all requested permissions on the first run of the app.


_This is an ongoing project as there are still a lot of work to be done on it. Some features are still lacking and I pretend to keep working on them. Suggestions are very welcome - and so are pull requests =-)_

Please help us spreading this app to blind individuals!
